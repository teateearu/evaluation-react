# README

An app that lists batches of students, each student has been evaluated with either green, yellow or red.

I built an algorithm that sorts the students based on their last evaluation, their teacher can then click the Random Student button and will have a 50% chance of asking a question from a 'red' student, 33% chance for a 'yellow' and 17% for a 'green' student.

Run it with 'yarn start' and in another tab the corresponding API https://github.com/teateearu/evaluation-api
